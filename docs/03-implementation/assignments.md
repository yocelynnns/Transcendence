# Task Assignments — Planning Template (Draft)

This document is used to plan task ownership collaboratively.
At this stage, **no assignments are finalized**.

The goal is to:
- understand team strengths
- align interests with project needs
- distribute work fairly
- avoid bottlenecks

Final assignments will be made after feature and architecture discussions.

## 1. Team Skills Assessment

These questions help identify strengths and learning goals:

- Who is most comfortable with frontend frameworks?
- Who has stronger backend or API experience?
- Who has worked with databases and schema design?
- Who is familiar with Docker and deployment?
- Who has experience with WebSockets or real-time systems?

---

## 2. Interest & Ownership Areas

Team members can indicate areas they are interested in owning or contributing to:

1. **Frontend UI / UX**
   - World rendering
   - Battle UI
   - Responsive layout

2. **Backend Logic**
   - Battle engine
   - Game rules
   - Authentication

3. **Database & API**
   - Schema design
   - REST APIs
   - Data persistence

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Docker setup
   - Environment configuration
   - Deployment

5. **Game Mechanics**
   - Pokémon data
   - Encounters
   - Progression systems

## 3. Sample Assignment Structure (Example)

Assignments will be tracked per phase or week.
This example illustrates the intended format only.

### Week 1 — Foundation (Example)
- Authentication system: [Name]
- Database schema setup: [Name]

## 4. Assignment Guidelines

- All team members are developers.
- Each member should own at least one primary system.
- Knowledge sharing is encouraged.
- Tasks may rotate to balance learning and productivity.
- No single person should become a bottleneck.

---

## 5. Discussion Points

- What does each team member want to work on?
- Where do we need redundancy for safety?
- How do we balance speed vs learning?
- When should ownership rotate?

## Notes

This document will be updated as:
- the tech stack is finalized
- features are confirmed
- the team agrees on workload distribution
